# Snipe-IT Custom ISO

Snipe-IT (https://snipeitapp.com/)is the best open source web-based inventory system that is have ever used. 

Spending some time on gitter.im/snipe/snipe-it, it was observed that most of the new comers run into a few challenges when trying to get up and running with Snipe-IT

The goal of this project is to eliminate or limit this challenge by creating a customised ISO where Snipe-IT will be installed without the user having to get their hands dirty.

However, if you don't want the hassel of updates and upgrades and faster turnover to your issues, it is recommended that you use the hosted option, more details can be found here ==> https://snipeitapp.com/hosting.

Below is the list of goals for this project

##### Configure an unattended installation of Snipe-IT using CentOS
##### Create customise scripts and aliases to perform Snipe-IT task
##### Make the OS menu driven for OS and Snipe-IT administration
